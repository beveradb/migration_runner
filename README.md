Python script to run SQL migration scripts sequentially from the specified folder,
updating latest schema version in the database itself after each migration.

**WARNING**: this tool was created purely as a technical demonstration on request.

It almost certainly should **not** be used for any real-world use case, as mature solutions
exist for almost every use case. See "Problem Overview" section of [NOTES](https://github.com/beveradb/migration_runner/blob/master/docs/NOTES.md) 
for further commentary on this topic. 

------------------------

## Requirements

* Python 2.7, or 3.5+
* Existing MySQL or MariaDB database, either running locally or on a remote host.
* Table called `versionTable`, with a single `int(11)` column named "version". See [here](https://github.com/beveradb/migration_runner/blob/master/sql-migrations/001.create_migrations_version_table.sql) for schema.
* Directory containing SQL scripts to execute to migrate the database to each version.
   * Each migration / version should have one file.
   * Files should be named to match the pattern `VERSION.brief_description.sql`,
     where VERSION is an integer representing the database version after executing that script.
* Version numbers should be unique and sequential for consistent results.

## Installation

To install Migration Runner, run this command in your terminal:

``` console
$ pip install migration_runner
```

This is the preferred method to install Migration Runner, as it will
always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python
installation
guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

For instructions on building from source, see the 
[documentation](https://migration_runner.readthedocs.io).

## Usage

Run the `migration_runner` script with `--help` to get usage instructions:

```
$ migration_runner --help

Usage: migration_runner [OPTIONS] SQL_DIRECTORY DB_USER DB_HOST DB_NAME DB_PASSWORD

  A cli tool for executing SQL migrations in sequence.

Options:
  -s, --single-file TEXT  Filename of single SQL script to process.
  -l, --loglevel LVL      Either CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO or DEBUG
  -v, --version           Show the version and exit.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```
